A brief list of "cheats" in the TPC-C implementation:

* The b-tree keys stuff the ids into a single int32_t, abusing the limits specified for the test. In a "real" system, these ids would be limited to something like an int32_t or an int64_t, so the btree keys would need to be significantly larger.

* We reorder the work in the new order transaction, even though that is not permitted. Section 2.4.2.3 states that the order of steps in the New Order transaction cannot be rearranged. To be fair, we should do the same in any other implementations we test.

* Delivery: we abuse o_ol_cnt instead of selecting (w_id, d_id, o_id, *).

* For the delivery transaction, Dan and Stavros's prototype used a "lowest new order" counter for each warehouse/district. When delivery took one transaction, it incremented the counter. This totally works, and is very efficient, but I believe that it is cheating. 2.3.3 states "Each attribute must be obtained from the designated table in the transaction profiles." Since we can actually do this using a tree, this version will do the "real" thing.

* Items table is an array. This does not support deletes, nor does it work if the table is "sparse." We should use some data structure which supports these operations.


PARTITIONING:
* We vertically partition stock and replicate s_data and s_dist_xx everywhere. The implementation currently does this by completely replicating stock. Worse than this, I don't think this scales: it is at least 28 MB of RAM on all nodes, per warehouse. I think using a two round transaction for this would be better, but it would be something that would be good to play with.

* paymentLocal currently creates the history line. If it is doing a paymentByName, it creates it with an invalid c_id (0). To fix this, we need to vertically partition and replicate warehouse w_name and district d_name, then create the history line on the remote partition. Or vertically partition the history table, creating unique h_ids to join the pieces together again.
